# Csharp
## Intro
Write a console app which starts by asking:
1. Category
2. Product Name
3. Price
## Level 1
Create classes for Category and Product. Use these classes when you add items to a list. You
should be able to add items to the list(s) until you write "q" (for quit).
Exit by presenting the list.
##Level 2
Add price and summarize inputs when presenting. Quit the list after "q" is written.
The list should be sorted from low price to high and a sum at the bottom.
##Level 3
Refactor your code using "Linq".
